		{
		"" "A placeable timer indicator.   "
		"" "Appears identical to the timer placed by standard puzzlemaker connections. Intended to be used in conjunction with the antline corner. Connection visibility should realistically always be set to none."
		"" ""
		"" "**Start Enabled:**   "
		"" "*When Checked*, the timer will begin to count down when activated.   "
		"" "*When Unchecked*, the timer will begin to count down when deactivated.   "
		"" ""
		"" "**Start Open:**   "
		"" "*When Checked*, the timer will emit a ticking sound as it runs."
		"" ""
		"" "**Start Reversed:**   "
		"" "*Start Reversed* changes the position of the indicator on the surface, as the quarter tile item does."
		"" ""
		"" "**Timer Delay:**  "
		"" "The task of determining the function of the *Timer Delay* on the Timer Item is left to the reader."
