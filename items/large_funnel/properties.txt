		{
		"" "A large funnel emitter.   "
		"" "Note that the funnel itself is *not* larger; only the emitter is. This item is a visual addition and has no special functionality.   "
		"" "Must embed to more voxels than the standard funnel. Backing cannot change to orange when the funnel reverses."
		"" ""
		"" "**IMPORTANT:**   "
		"" "This item uses *A/B Inputs* in order to control both the ability to change the funnel's active state and the funnel's polarity, as the normal interface cannot be transferred from the original funnel item.   "
		"" "To connect inputs into this item:   "
		"" "1. Place the *A/B Input* items into your map. They can be found among BEE's default items and are associated with the *S/R Latch*"
		"" "2. Connect both *Input A* and *Input B* into the funnel."
		"" "3. Connect all inputs which you wish to *change active state* into *Input A*."
		"" "4. Connect all inputs which you wish to *change polarity* into *Input B*."
		"" ""
		"" "**WARNING:**   "
		"" "Do not place the funnel directly next to a wall such that it can clip outside of the map. Do not allow antlines, indicators, etc. to roam onto the edges of the funnel."
		"" ""
		"" "**Start Enabled:**   "
		"" "Same as default funnel item."
		"" ""
		"" "**Start Reversed:**   "
		"" "Same as default funnel item."

//Cute visual addition and nothing more.
//I noticed recently that the model seems to spin a lot faster than the actual projected funnel - worth investigating, or natural consequence?
//Can Wii2's method be applied to large funnels, so we could have an orange backing? Wouldn't be surprised. May want to check.

//It might be possible to make the funnel frame more efficient. Right now it is chopped up so we can get visleaves to cut nicely on the inside of the funnel.
