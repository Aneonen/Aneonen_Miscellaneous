		"" "- *Reflective* forms the a center piece of a wider staircase."
		"" "- *Sphere* forms the right edge of a wider staircase."
		"" "- *Franken* forms an independent stair that is not meant to have edges and can be combined with other Franken stairs freely, similar to the standard block stairs."

		"" "__Start Enabled__, when checked, will switch the item to a dense, flat staircase instead of the standard semi-sloped one."

		"" "Note that the stair items have __nodraw__ (invisible-like) textures on faces that are not meant to be exposed; if you see nodraw, the stairs are being configured incorrectly!"

//These stairs are made slightly less efficient than my personal version in exchange for being more flexible
//They could potentially use some changes in the future. Like the standard BEE funnel frame (and presumably some other templates),
//	the surface could be checked before template selection and a more efficinet set of stairs could be chosen if there were no color
//	differences per row. This would be particularly helpful for the flat stairs.
//The flat stairs could also be pushed back slightly and any voxel behind the item could be textured with squarebeams, as is the case
//	with the standard block stairs. Right now they push out a little to make elevating to glass/etc. a little cleaner and to keep consistent
//	with the sloped stairs, which can`t be pushed back so easily.
//TeamSpen has also proposed that some functionality could be implemented to check adjacent items and automatically shift the block stairs component accordingly.
//The lightmap scaling is a little inexperienced right now as well, and might be inefficient.
