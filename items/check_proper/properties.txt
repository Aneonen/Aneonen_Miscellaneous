		"" "A placeable checkmark indicator.   "
		"" "Appears identical to the checkmark placed by standard puzzlemaker connections. Intended to be used in conjunction with the antline corner. Connection visibility should realistically always be set to none.   "
		"" "When placed on a wall, the check will always orient upwards. When placed on a floor or ceiling, the check will always orient to face outwards."

		"" "**Start Enabled:**   "
		"" "*When Checked*, the checkmark will begin enabled."
		"" ""
		"" "**Start Reversed:**   "
		"" "*Start Reversed* changes the position of the indicator on the surface, as the quarter tile item does."

//It's a bit unfortunate that this item doesn't always orient nicely towards a connection on the floor. I am not sure how to implement this without a clunky extra selection item. Maybe if the antline corner was edited something could happen, but that is beyond my area of 'expertise.'

//It is extremely unlikely, but a few authors still use older BEE version, so in the _rare_ case that one of them wants to at least try to use this package, I included the quarter tile models.
